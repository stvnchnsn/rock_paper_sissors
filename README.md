# rock_paper_sissors
## Motivation
Late on a Saturday night I was watching the YouTubes and I was inspried by a video from Numberphile about Rock Paper Sissors.  As I was laying there half asleep I decided to challenge myself to write a basic program play Rock Paper Sissors against a random bot within 30 mins.  I was able to complete the challenge and I've been expanding the scope of this project every since.

## Ultimate goal
Create a side scrolling Rock Paper Sissors themed game with hard wired algorithm bots (some based off the Japanese Rock Paper Sissors study that was mentioned in the Numperphile video), and AI bots.
